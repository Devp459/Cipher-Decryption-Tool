Designed and implemented a substitution cipher decryption tool using a hill-climbing algorithm to optimize key discovery for accurate decryption of ciphertext.

Developed an interactive command-line interface that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using both Caesar and substitution ciphers, enhancing usability.

Integrated file input handling to facilitate reading ciphertext from files, improving efficiency for larger datasets.

Created a scoring mechanism using quadgram analysis to evaluate the "English-ness" of decrypted text, ensuring high-quality outputs.
